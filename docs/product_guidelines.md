# Product Guidelines: Momentum

## Mission

Our primary mission is to build an **end-to-end complete project**. We will not leave features half-baked or components unfinished. The goal is a polished, production-ready application.

## Core Principles

1. **Completeness**: Every feature started must be finished.
2. **Quality**: Code quality and UI/UX should be high standard.
3. **Documentation**: Keep track of what is done and what is not.
